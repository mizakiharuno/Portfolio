# Responsive Design and Bootstrap Grid System
In this exercise I implemented Bootstrap into the webpage from [Getting Started with Bootstrap](https://github.com/mizakiharuno/Portfolio/tree/main/FrontEndWebUIFramworksAndTools-Bootstrap4/Exercises/GettingStartedwithBootstrap), and also added some custom CSS.  Note that I needed to use some utility classes within bootstrap as the jumbotron class was deprecated in my current version (5.2.0-beta1):
```html
<header class="jumbotron">
```
Became[^1]:
```html
<header class="p-5 jumbotron">
```

[^1]: Note I still had a jumbotron custom css class.
