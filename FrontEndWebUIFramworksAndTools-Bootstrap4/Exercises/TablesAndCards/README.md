# Table and Cards
In this exercise we created Bootstrap Cards as well as implemented a table into our website. I had to change a few classes due to Bootstrap 5 differences:

```html
<thead class="thead-dark">
```
Became
```html
<thead class="table-dark">
```

Also:
```html
<p class="mb-0">
```
I had to remove the mb-0 due to the way Bootstrap formats cards and blockquotes.
