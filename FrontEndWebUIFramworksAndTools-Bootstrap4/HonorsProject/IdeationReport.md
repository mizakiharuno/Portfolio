# Travelander
Your one-stop-shop for travel plans.

## Introduction
I have had this idea for a website design for a long time, and it might be a bit ambitious for this class. However, Iâ€™m going to give it a go.

My idea is a traveling website designed around the user planning out their travels.  I want to call it Travlendar (Travel + Calendar).  I want it to be a place that people can design a trip and share it with friends/family.  It will bring a succinct experience for users to have all their travel itinerary and budget in one easy place.


## Expected List of Features
- Google Maps API integration that allows users to break down their travel.
- An estimated cost analysis of gas and time based on path of travelling (if travelling by car)
- Hotel location and attraction location integration.
- Custom events and plans integration.
- Ability to share a link to the plans.
- Cost breakdown of vacation.
- Capability to add other users to the travel experience, allowing them to edit plans or propose ideas.
- Break down costs and splits for participants.

Google Maps will be an integral necessity in order to meet a lot of the other functions.  I want to be able to breakdown as much of the users travel plans as possible in order for them to see what they need to budget (time/money).  I also would like to assure that any group plans can be budgeted and split across the group and all members can know their financial commitments.


## Market Survey
The following sites have similar ideas:
1. [Wander Log](https://wanderlog.com/)
2. [Inspirock](https://www.inspirock.com/)
3. [Trip Hobo](https://www.triphobo.com/)
4. [tripit](https://www.tripit.com/web)
5. [Pebblar](https://pebblar.com/)

Wander Log has a lot of similarities but seems to lack cost breakdown.  Developing a travel itinerary and being able to break the cost up amongst participants, or just understanding your budget is important.

Inspirock has a lot of a prebuilt trips and itineraries that you can choose from, and it allows you to customize those trips.  However, it lacks the collaborative features I'd like to implement.

Triphobo is really succinct and definitely a competitor for how I want to design things. However, I feel that their prebuilt itinerary concept is nice, but not what I am looking for. My system will be designed for users that want 100% freedom and no advertised activities popping into their feed.

Tripit seems like a nice place that congregates all your traveling data into one area, but once again I'm noticing a lacking of collaboration features that I want to implement into my design.

Pebblar seems to be the closest to what I want to do (maybe closely tied with Wander Log). However, both of these apps lack financial breakdowns and analytics.  To me understanding not just time estimates, but cost estimates and breakdowns are important.
