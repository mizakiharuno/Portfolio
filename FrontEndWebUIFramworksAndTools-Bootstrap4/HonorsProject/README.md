# Honors Project
This is the location of my Honors Project.  I'm developing a site called Travlender and will update this file with relevant information as I proceed.  This will likely span over multiple courses on [coursera](coursera.org), and I will truncate my process in this directory when I move to another course.

You can get a general outline of what my goals are from the [Ideation Report](https://github.com/mizakiharuno/Portfolio/blob/main/FrontEndWebUIFramworksAndTools-Bootstrap4/HonorsProject/IdeationReport.md)
