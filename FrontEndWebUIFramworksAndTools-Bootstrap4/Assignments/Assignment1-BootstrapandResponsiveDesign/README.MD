# Assignment 1
## Bootstrap and Responsive Design
For this assignment, we were provided the aboutus.html file.  We were tasked with updating the file to contain responsive web design classes provided via Bootstrap.  I had to change the following:
```html
<header class="jumbotron">
```
To:
```html
<header class="p-5 jumbotron">
```
Due to differences in my current version of Bootstrap (5.2.0-beta1).[^1]

[^1]: Note I still had a jumbotron custom css class.
