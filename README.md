This is my professional portfolio of projects/assignments I have completed.

## Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4
This [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bootstrap-4/home/) is located on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), and I used it to learn about the Framework Bootstrap.  Though it says Bootstrap 4, I used the most recent version of Bootstrap at the time (5.2.0-beta1).
